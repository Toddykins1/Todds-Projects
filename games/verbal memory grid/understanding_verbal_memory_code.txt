VERBAL MEMORY GAME - COMPREHENSIVE CODE ANALYSIS
================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
The Verbal Memory Game is a web-based memory training game where players must identify whether words appearing on a grid are "new" (never seen before) or "seen" (previously encountered). The game tests and improves verbal memory through progressive difficulty and time pressure.

CORE GAMEPLAY MECHANICS
-----------------------

1. GRID SYSTEM
   - Responsive grid that adapts to screen size
   - Desktop: 5x3 grid (5 columns, 3 rows)
   - Mobile/Portrait: 3x5 grid (3 columns, 5 rows)
   - Grid automatically recalculates on window resize
   - Tiles are square and maintain aspect ratio

2. WORD SPAWNING SYSTEM
   - Words appear randomly on available tiles
   - Each word has a radial sweep timer (starts at 15 seconds, decreases by 1 second per round, minimum 5 seconds)
   - Spawn interval: 0.8-3.2 seconds between new words
   - No duplicate words can appear simultaneously on the grid

3. WORD SELECTION LOGIC
   - Massive word bank of 1000+ words across multiple categories:
     * Travel-related words (adventure, airport, journey, etc.)
     * Academic/technical terms (algorithm, hypothesis, etc.)
     * Emotional/psychological terms (anxiety, courage, etc.)
     * Sensory/descriptive words (velvet, marble, smooth, etc.)
     * Action/playful words (bounce, giggle, zoom, etc.)
   - First 3 words are always new (unseen)
   - After that: 53% chance of new word, increasing by 3% per round (max 89%)
   - Tracks seen words in a Set for efficient lookup

4. INPUT HANDLING
   - Desktop: Left-click for NEW words, Right-click for SEEN words
   - Mobile: Long-tap (450ms) for NEW words, Short-tap for SEEN words
   - Prevents context menu on right-click
   - Handles touch events with proper passive/active flags

5. SCORING SYSTEM
   - Score increments for correct identifications
   - Strike system: 3 strikes = game over
   - Visual feedback with color-coded messages:
     * Green "Correct" for right answers
     * Red "Was seen"/"Was new" for wrong answers
     * Red "Timed Out" for expired words

6. TIMER AND ROUNDS
   - 60-second rounds
   - Round counter increments when timer reaches 0
   - Timer resets to 60 seconds each round
   - Visual glow effects on timer/round updates

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
----------------------

1. RESPONSIVE DESIGN
   - CSS Grid for layout management
   - Dynamic tile sizing based on available space
   - Media queries for mobile optimization
   - Viewport units (vw, vh, dvh) for consistent sizing

2. ANIMATION SYSTEM
   - Canvas-based radial sweep animation for word timers
   - CSS animations for feedback messages
   - Glow effects using text-shadow animations
   - Smooth transitions for UI state changes

3. STATE MANAGEMENT
   - Global variables for game state (score, strikes, round, timer)
   - Set data structure for efficient word tracking
   - Timer management with setInterval/clearInterval
   - Event handler attachment/detachment for overlays

4. MEMORY MANAGEMENT
   - Proper cleanup of timers and event listeners
   - DOM element removal to prevent memory leaks
   - Animation frame cancellation for performance

KEY FUNCTIONS BREAKDOWN
-----------------------

1. GRID MANAGEMENT
   - getGridConfig(): Determines grid dimensions based on screen size
   - updateGrid(): Recreates grid layout and tiles
   - getAllTiles(): Returns array of all tile elements
   - getAvailableTileIndices(): Finds empty tiles for word placement

2. WORD SYSTEM
   - pickWordNoDuplicates(): Core word selection logic with probability
   - createRadialSweepOverlay(): Creates animated word display with timer
   - spawnWordInRandomTile(): Places word on random available tile
   - scheduleNextWordSpawn(): Manages word spawn timing

3. INPUT HANDLING
   - attachWordInputHandlers(): Sets up click/touch events for words
   - handleWordClickAction(): Processes user input and updates game state
   - showTileFeedback(): Displays result feedback on tiles

4. GAME FLOW
   - startGame(): Initializes game state and starts word spawning
   - showGameOverOverlay(): Handles game end with statistics
   - resetForStartOverlay(): Prepares for new game session

5. UI MANAGEMENT
   - updateScoreDisplay(): Updates score with glow effect
   - updateStrikesDisplay(): Manages strike indicators
   - updateTimerDisplay(): Formats and displays countdown
   - triggerGlow(): Creates visual feedback animations

VISUAL DESIGN ELEMENTS
----------------------

1. COLOR SCHEME
   - Dark theme: #111622 background
   - Tile color: #181f2c
   - Text: #e9f0ff with blue shadows
   - Accent: #657ae8 for borders and highlights
   - Feedback: Green (#3bc157) for correct, Red (#e03b45) for incorrect

2. TYPOGRAPHY
   - Rubik font family for modern, readable text
   - Responsive font sizing with mobile optimization
   - Text shadows for depth and readability
   - Dynamic text fitting to prevent overflow

3. ANIMATIONS
   - Radial sweep timer with canvas rendering
   - Feedback message animations with scale and fade
   - Glow effects for score/timer updates
   - Smooth hover effects on tiles

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS
-------------------------

1. EFFICIENT DATA STRUCTURES
   - Set for O(1) word lookup
   - Array filtering for available tiles
   - Proper timer cleanup to prevent memory leaks

2. DOM OPTIMIZATION
   - Minimal DOM manipulation
   - Event delegation where appropriate
   - Proper element removal and cleanup

3. ANIMATION PERFORMANCE
   - requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
   - Canvas for complex visual effects
   - CSS transforms for hardware acceleration

ACCESSIBILITY FEATURES
----------------------
